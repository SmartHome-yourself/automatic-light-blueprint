# automatic-light-blueprint
### (experimental)

This blueprint is a simple template for automatically turning on/off one or more lamps.  
Optionally, switching on can also be made dependent on the position of the sun.  
In addition, there is a timeout after which the light is also switched off after being switched on manually if no movement was detected during this period.
